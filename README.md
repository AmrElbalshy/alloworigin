# alloworigin.com
Django implementation of anyorigin.com    
Uses Django, [requests lib](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) and [tor](https://www.torproject.org/)

**what is the difference between anyorigin.com and alloworigin.com?**  
Well, while alloworigin.com is open source and free to use,  
anyorigin.com is closed source and not free.

**whateverorigin.org is open source and free, why use alloworigin.com?**  
whateverorigin.org is a good alternative to anyorigin.com, but  
it has not been maintained well, thus some basic functions remain [broken](https://github.com/ripper234/Whatever-Origin/issues/10)  
alloworigin.com is an attemp to fix this. 
alloworigin.com is written in Django, which has awesome community.
